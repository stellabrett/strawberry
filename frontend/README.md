# Frontend

This directory contains the Progressive Web App (PWA) frontend for Strawberry.

## Overview

The frontend is a client-side only application that runs entirely in the browser, maintaining the privacy-first principles of the project.

## Key Technologies

- **PWA**: Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
- **Service Workers**: For caching and offline functionality
- **IndexedDB**: For local data storage
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, works on all devices

## Privacy Implementation

All data processing and storage happens client-side in the browser:
- No API calls to external servers
- No user authentication or tracking
- Local-only data persistence with IndexedDB
- Complete offline functionality after initial load

## Getting Started

Development setup instructions will be added here as the frontend is implemented.
